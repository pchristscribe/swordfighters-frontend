DHgate MCP Server Evaluation Questions

These questions test whether LLMs can effectively use the DHgate MCP server to answer
realistic affiliate marketing questions. Each question requires multiple tool calls,
deep exploration, and combines data from different sources.

Requirements for Running:
- DHGATE_API_TOKEN must be configured with valid TMAPI credentials
- Server must be running and accessible
- All questions use read-only operations

Note: Answers will vary based on current DHgate product catalog. These questions are
designed to test the MCP server's capabilities, not to verify specific product data.
The answer placeholders below should be replaced with actual results after running
evaluations with live API access.
