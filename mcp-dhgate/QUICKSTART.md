## Step 1: Get Your API Token (5 minutes)

```

## Step 3: Test the Build

```

## Step 4: Configure Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dhgate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/pscribbler/ProjectXY/mcp-dhgate/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DHGATE_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Use the **full absolute path** to index.js!

## Step 5: Restart Claude Desktop

1. Quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q)
2. Reopen Claude Desktop
3. Look for the 🔌 icon indicating MCP servers are connected

## Step 6: Test the Server

Try these commands in Claude Desktop:

### Test 1: Basic Search
```
Search DHgate for "wireless headphones" sorted by rating
```

Expected: List of wireless headphones with ratings and prices

### Test 2: With Filters
```
Find "smart watch" products with free shipping and high ratings
```

Expected: Filtered list of highly-rated smart watches with free shipping

### Test 3: Generate Affiliate Link
```
Generate an affiliate link for this DHgate product:
https://www.dhgate.com/product/example/123456.html
```

Expected: Tracked affiliate URL with FTC compliance reminder

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Server Not Appearing in Claude

**Check**:
1. Is the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` absolute?
2. Does `dist/index.js` exist?
3. Did you restart Claude Desktop?

**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls /Users/pscribbler/ProjectXY/mcp-dhgate/dist/index.js

# Check for typos in JSON config
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### ❌ Authentication Failed

**Error**: `API authentication failed`

**Fix**:
1. Verify token in .env file
2. Verify token in claude_desktop_config.json
3. Check token is valid at TMAPI console
4. Ensure no extra spaces in token

### ❌ No Products Found

**Error**: `No products found`

**Fix**:
- Try different keywords
- Remove filters (free_shipping, high_rating)
- Check DHgate actually has those products

### ❌ Rate Limit Exceeded

**Error**: `Rate limit exceeded`

**Fix**: Wait 60 seconds. The server allows 60 requests/minute.
